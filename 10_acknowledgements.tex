We would like to thank Professors Sergei Tabachnikov, Richard Schwartz, Arseniy Akopyan, Olga Romaskevich, and Igor Minevich for invaluable mentoring, and key proofs. We would like to thank Profs. Jorge Zubelli, Marcus Craizer, Matt Perlmuter, and Ethan Cotterill, for inviting us for a talk at IMPA, PUC-RJ, UFF-RJ, and UFMG, respectively, and Paulo Ney de Souza for encouraging us to pursue this work and helping with the typesetting. We also thank Mark Helman for contributing proofs for the ellipticity of several triangular centers and Dominique Laurain for contributing (via Youtube!) a surprising expression for the radius of the Cosine Circle.
